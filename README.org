#+TITLE:Critic.el
An Emacs minor-mode for [[http://criticmarkup.com/][CriticMarkup]]. In its early stages but does provide syntax highlightning and the option to apply the suggested changes. Use the following:

- =M-x critic-minor-mode=
- =M-x critic-at-point=
- =M-x critic-buffer=

The main functionality missing is to add the markup to the =org-mode= exporter.
