#+TITLE:Critic.el
An Emacs minor-mode for [[http://criticmarkup.com/][CriticMarkup]]. In its early stages but does provide syntax highlightning, the option to apply the suggested changes, and =org-mode= HTML export. Use the following:

- =M-x critic-minor-mode=
- =M-x critic-at-point=
- =M-x critic-buffer=

When exporting to HTML from =org-mode=, the CriticMarkup will be exported according to the [[http://criticmarkup.com/spec.php][CriticMarkup spec]]. =critic.el= does not add any extra CSS to the HTML output, so this has to be done by you if you want to style the document.
